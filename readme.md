# Safe-House

A story about me creating a website, trying to stop changing mind everyday.

## Usage

To dev comfy, use 2 shells :
- One for watching typescript : `yarn tsc --watch`
- One for watching building files, and keeping the process up : `yarn dev`

## Requirements

* Node.js > v10
* Yarn or Npm, check script cat in package.json for your convenience.
